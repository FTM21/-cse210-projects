//Comments: - Exceeding requirements: The program effectively utilizes encapsulation with private member variables in the Scripture, 
//Word, and Reference classes. It features clear responsibilities for each class, displaying scriptures accurately
// and hiding words interactively. Additionally, enhancements include a robust scripture library more than required, 
//random selection of this scripture, and a user-friendly interface, exceeding basic requirements.
